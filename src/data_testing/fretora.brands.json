    "description": "The Ibanez story begins in Nagoya, Japan’s fourth most populous city and one of its key trade ports. Also based in Nagoya was Hoshino Shoten, a bookstore chain that – due to the increased demand for Western instruments as a result of the Westernisation of Japan in the late 19th and early 20th century – established a musical instrument division, Hoshino Gakki (‘gakki’ means ‘musical instrument’ in Japanese), to import high-end classical guitars to the country. From the late 1920s onwards, Hoshino Gakki began importing instruments crafted by a legendary Spanish master luthier by the name of Salvador Ibanez. Now, Hoshino Gakki wasn’t the only company to import Ibanez’s instruments – several others did, most notably Yamaha – but in the 1930s Hoshino Gakki did something that would bind the two names together forever more. In 1935 the bods at Hoshino Gakki decided that instead of simply importing instruments from Spain, they would begin to craft their own guitars in Japan, and in honor of the master luthier who had inspired the instruments (and cynically, probably also because of his good reputation) , they were branded ‘Ibanez Salvador’, which then was shortened to simply Ibanez.",

    "description": "The Fender story begins over 70 years ago in a small Fullerton, California workshop. A radio repairman by trade and inventor at heart, Leo Fender made the transition to musical instruments by default, tinkering with his friends’ faulty amps. In 1943, he teamed up with local musician and inventor Doc Kaufmann and formed K&F Manufacturing Corp, producing a limited run of amplifiers and lap steel guitars at the height of the Hawaiian music craze. When the two parted ways a few years later, Fender continued working under his own name, developing the original Princeton, Deluxe and Professional amps in 1946. Built with hardwood cabinets, Fender’s original “woodie” amps—as they’ve come to be known in collectors’ circles—were among the first products to bear the official Fender seal. In a new post-World War II era when rugged, reliable and suitably loud instrument amplification didn’t really exist, the simple and stylish woodies were by far the best amps of their time—and would go on to set the gold standard for guitar tone throughout the 60s, 70s and beyond.",

The 1000 series LTDs are made on an assembly line in Korea whereas the 401 series and below are made in Indonesia. LTD basses are instruments mainly aimed at beginners. Over the years manufacturing has moved between various locations, including Vietnam, China and Indonesia. Intermediate models were manufactured in Korea in the early 2000s (decade). The quality from these has led to continued demand for the LTD series.",

    "description": "Yamaha guitars have captivated the ears of listeners and players for over 60 years. The company’s wide range of acoustic and electric models remain ubiquitous in every kind of musical genre, from classical to folk to hard rock. Renowned for their playability and durability as well as their distinctive look and tonality, these guitars have been played by generations of musicians and have appeared on countless numbers of recordings and concert stages. Yamaha entered the global guitar market in 1966 with the release of the FG180 folk guitar, which was developed using a proprietary design and engineered in-house. Its symmetrical dreadnought-style body featured slightly emphasized cutaways, resulting in  a rich, bright tone and excellent sound projection. This was one LOUD guitar! During the first half of the 1970s, Yamaha expanded its acoustic offerings. Two 6-string folk guitar models (the FG-1500 and FG-2000) and a 12-string variant (the FG-2500) arrived in 1971, combining old-world build quality with modern specs and superior materials such as solid spruce tops and solid jacaranda backs and sides. The music industry shifted towards digital and synthesized sounds throughout the ’80s. As trends changed during that decade of flashy glam and excess, so too did the instruments. The futuristic Yamaha SF-7000 electric, for example, offered different bridges for each model, giving players multiple options depending on their playing style. The music world — and, by extension, the tastes and styles of guitarists — is constantly in flux. Yet for more than half a century, Yamaha guitars have retained their prestige thanks to the diligence of designers, builders, developers and the feedback of players. From the first FG180 folk guitar to the latest TransAcoustic models, Yamaha continues to pave the way.",
